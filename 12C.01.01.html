        Working with fonts and UI cards

        <p>
          In this assignment we were able to play around with different Google
          fonts. The assigntment was a bit abstract to me since the content of
          the website handed to us was not spicific - a sort of "non-content".
          Choosing fonts depends very much on the content of the website and the
          users. So choosing fotns for fake content was actually very hard. But
          the assignment also had us working with font hieraki which is very
          good tool to have. Second part of the assigntment was styling cards.
          Also a hard task when content is important. But I played around with
          it and made them look at least better than they were originally!
